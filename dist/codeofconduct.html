            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>All agents must follow the Code of Conduct for agents. This means the agent must meet the obligations set out in the Code of Conduct. Your agent will provide you with a copy of the Code if you ask for it.
                <a href="#">Code of Conduct for registered migration agents</a></p>
            <h2>Consumer Guide</h2>
            <p>When you sign a contract, your agent must give you a copy of the Consumer Guide. The Consumer Guide includes a summary of the Code, what you can expect from your agent, what the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority does, and how you can complain to us if you need to.
                <a href="#">Consumer Guide</a></p>
            <h2>Your relationship with your agent</h2>
            <p>Your agent is working for you, but they need your help to do so. You need to cooperate with your agent and respond to any reasonable requests they make.

                You need to know that your agent must give DIBP, the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal all the information they need to decide your visa application.

                After your application is lodged, your agent might need to provide more information to these organisations by a specific date. If this is not provided in time, your application may be refused. So you need to respond quickly when your agent asks you for information or documents.

                Your agent should provide you with details of how you can contact them during normal business hours. They do not have to be available outside of normal business hours.</p>
            <h2>Progress reports</h2>
            <p>Your agent must let you know in writing about the progress of your application. Some applications can take longer to process so there will be times when your agent has nothing to tell you.

                Talk to your agent about how much time it might take and what the steps will be, so you know what to expect.

                Your agent must write to you about the outcome of your application as soon as possible.</p>
            <h2>Conflict of interest</h2>
            <p>A conflict of interest occurs when actions or decisions are influenced (or thought to be influenced) by personal factors.

                Your agent should not represent you if they have a conflict of interest. Your agent must put your legitimate interests above their own and avoid situations where there is self-interest.</p>
            <h3>In both of these examples of a conflict of interest, the agent is putting their own interest (making money) above the best interest of their client:</h3>
            <p>1. Your agent may have an agreement with an education facility where they receive money for each person they refer to that education facility after helping them to obtain a visa. Your agent advises you this is the best education facility for you to attend once you have your visa.</p>
            <p>2. Your agent or a member of their family has money invested in a business.  Your agent advises you to invest in that business in order to satisfy certain visa requirements.</p>
            <p>If your agent discovers they have a conflict of interest at any time while representing you, they must tell you straight away they can no longer work for you.</p>
            <h2>Termination of contract</h2>
            <p>Your contract can be stopped (terminated) by you or your agent at any time or if you both agree to do so (mutual agreement).

                If your agent terminates your contract, they must first give you reasonable written notice.

                When your contract is terminated, your agent should provide you with an invoice (a written statement of services) showing the services they performed for you and any money you need to pay for those services.

                You are entitled to get back money you paid in advance for fees for services your agent did not provide.</p>
            <p>Your agent must return to you, within seven days, any documents that belong to you. However if your agent is a lawyer they can claim a lien (a form of security over an item until a debt is paid) for outstanding fees you need to pay.</p>
